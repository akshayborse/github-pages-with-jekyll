Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance.

Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.

Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.
